# Grant Central: The $1,000,000 Prank Website 🎉

A playful, intentionally tricky prank website that challenges visitors to find the hidden Contact Us page to "claim their prize." The site is filled with clever puzzles, misleading navigation, hidden clues, and Easter eggs—all while remaining fair, non-harmful, and clearly fictional once revealed.

## 🎯 The Challenge

**The Goal:** Find the Contact Us page to claim your $1,000,000 grant!

**The Twist:** The Contact Us link has been removed from the main navigation. Visitors must:
- Notice what's missing from the nav menu
- Follow hidden clues scattered throughout the site
- Solve interactive puzzles
- Check the browser console for hints
- Use critical thinking to figure out the page URL

## 🌐 Website Structure

### Pages Included:
- **index.html** - Landing page with misleading buttons and initial clues
- **about.html** - Company info with color puzzles, password protection, and hidden messages
- **faq.html** - Frequently asked questions with puzzle hints and morse code clues
- **terms.html** - Terms & conditions with vertical letter hints spelling "CONTACT"
- **privacy.html** - Privacy policy with direct hints about finding the contact page
- **contact.html** - The ultimate goal! Victory page with form and puzzle reveal
- **styles.css** - All styling with animations and visual effects
- **script.js** - Interactive mechanics, console clues, and Easter eggs

## 🧩 Puzzle Mechanisms

### 1. **Missing Navigation**
The Contact Us link is absent from the navbar. Visitors notice: "Why is there no Contact link?"

### 2. **Word Repetition Clues**
The word "CONTACT" appears repeatedly throughout the site:
- In the FAQ as a puzzle answer
- Spelled vertically in the Terms page
- In color-coded boxes on About page
- In password protection puzzles

### 3. **Direct URL Approach**
Most websites follow standard naming: `contact.html` or `contact` or `/contact-us`
Smart visitors simply try typing: `contact.html` in the browser address bar

### 4. **Interactive Puzzles**
- **About Page Password:** Enter "CONTACT" to unlock a direct link
- **FAQ Puzzle:** Answer "What do you do when you want to talk to a business?" with "Contact"
- **Color-Coded Letters:** Spell out "CONTACT"

### 5. **Browser Console Clues**
Open DevTools (F12 / Ctrl+Shift+I) to find:
- "CLUE 1: The contact link was removed from navigation"
- "CLUE 2: Check the page comments for more hints"
- Detailed hints and encouragement

### 6. **Hidden HTML Comments**
Page source code contains hints like:
```html
<!-- The real contact page: contact.html -->
<!-- Try typing the URL directly or finding hidden links -->
```

### 7. **Easter Eggs**
- **Keyboard Shortcut:** Press Ctrl+Shift+C for a surprise
- **Random Text Effects:** Hover over text for random funny messages (2% chance)
- **Morse Code:** Footer contains morse code spelling "CONTACT US HIDDEN"

### 8. **Visual Clues**
- Tooltip text with hints
- "Invisible text" that becomes visible on hover
- Stacked letters spelling CONTACT
- Glitching and blinking text effects

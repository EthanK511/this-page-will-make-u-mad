            <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. By using this website, you agree to terms that are... somewhere. Maybe in this document. Maybe not.</p>

            <h3>Section 2: The Important Part</h3>
            <p><span class="highlighted">The grant is real. The route to claim it is REALLY real. You must find the CONTACT page. It's called "contact" something. Maybe .html? Who knows?</span></p>

            <h3>Section 3: What You Should Know</h3>
            <p>Grant Central is a totally real, not-at-all fictional company that is definitely going to give you money if you can find our contact form. We promise.</p>

            <h3>Section 5: Legal Jargon</h3>
            <p>Grant Central LLC hereby declares that this is a fun game and totally fictional. Your grant is metaphorical and worth its weight in laughs.</p>
